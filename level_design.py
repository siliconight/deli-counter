level_design.py  --  felt-space enrichment layer (no bpy)
=========================================================
Applies validated FPS level-design principles to a finished preset spec so
buildings come out *better by construction*, not merely measurable after the
fact. This is the generative companion to sightlines.py (which only reports):
sightlines tells you a room plays badly; this puts the anchors there so it
plays well in the first place.

Principles distilled from the references B$ collected:
  * McMillan  -- line of sight is the dial that sets difficulty; cover and
                 portals are how you turn it.
  * Foreman   -- a level is ambiguity management; SIGHTLINES are the biggest
                 lever, every sightline needs a risk/reward, LANDMARKS go in
                 first so players spend attention on opponents, not navigation;
                 if a corner rewards camping, it needs more circulation or less
                 cover.
  * Epic (Fortnite) -- aim for ~3-5 quickly-recognizable POINTS OF ENGAGEMENT
                 per space (cover / window / ledge), and distinct CALLOUT
                 landmarks you can read from a distance.
  * SMU mid-area thesis -- DON'T over-cover (it destroys enemy-position
                 readability), keep callout areas visually distinct, stage
                 attackers before they're exposed.

DELCO is a PAYDAY-style 4-player PvE co-op heist loop, NOT a PvP-symmetric
shooter -- so this layer is about the felt space (cover cadence, callout
legibility, readable engagement) that holds regardless of who the opponent is,
not attacker/defender entrance symmetry.

CONTRACT
  * Pure Python, no bpy. Operates on the spec dict.
  * ADDITIVE and IDEMPOTENT: only ever appends anchors, never moves or removes
    one, and re-running is a no-op. Geometry is never touched -- an enrichment
    pass can no more break a level than an art pass can.
  * Anchors only (markers). The game still owns what an anchor *means*.

Tunables live in the module-level constants so a preset author can reason about
them. enrich(spec) is the single entry point; make() calls it by default.

    """Give every combat room something to fight from, and bare ones furniture.

    TWO PASSES, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WAYS A COMBAT ROOM FAILS and only one of
    them used to be looked at.

      * BARE. Big room, combat intent, not one solid in it -- the audit calls
        it a kill box. Gets 2-4 archetype pieces, spread out.
      * FURNISHED AND UNFIGHTABLE. Crates, desks, a counter, all modelled and
        lit, and every one of them short enough that both sides shoot over the
        top. Gets ONE piece at `shelter_height()` and keeps its furniture.

    The second was invisible: the guard was `_room_has_cover`, which answers
    "is there furniture here", so a room full of 0.9 m crates was covered and
    skipped, and the one thing it lacked was the one thing never added. **39
    of the 91 combat rooms in the shipped presets.** They look built and they
    cannot be fought in, which is the failure that survives a look at the
    screen.

    ONE piece, not a raise of the furniture. The brief for these levels is
    props that give cover AND life without overkill; a furnished room is not
    short of life. The over-cover thesis this module is built on argues
    against the alternative directly.

    Deterministic (spec seed + room id), additive, idempotent -- a re-run sees
    the shelter piece and skips -- and it never places near a door, an
    objective, a stair or a ladder. A room where nothing fits keeps its
    finding rather than getting a crate jammed into a doorway.

    Returns the number of volumes created.
